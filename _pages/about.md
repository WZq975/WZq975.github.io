I am currently a second-year PhD student supervised by Prof. [Yang Wang](https://users.encs.concordia.ca/~wayang/) in [Concordia University](https://www.concordia.ca/). I recieved my Bachelor and Master's degrees in 2019 and 2022 from [Shanghai University](https://www.shu.edu.cn/). My research interests lie in the fields of computer vision and machine learning, which were kindled during my Master's degree under the supervision of Prof. [Zhi Liu](https://www.ivp.shu.edu.cn/Default.aspx?tabid=31916).
